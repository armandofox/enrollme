Feature: Show students who do not have a team
  As a students
  I want to find students who do not have a team
  So that I can invite a single student to team or form a team with a single student

    And team "passcode1" has 0 pending requests
    And team "passcode2" has 2 pending requests
    And team "passcode3" has 1 pending request
    
    And team "passcode1" is declared
    And team "passcode2" is declared
    And team "passcode3" is not declared

    And I am on the home page
    And I log in as a user with email "bobjones0@berkeley.edu"
    And I follow "Team List"
    
    Scenario: A student looks for students who do not have a team
    When I press "Single Students"
    Then I should see "Bobby"
    And I should not see "Bob"
