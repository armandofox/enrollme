Feature: display all the teams
  As a user
  In order to find an open team that suits my preferences
  I want to see all the currently open teams and be able to view, sort, and join/leave them
  
# Background: teams have been added to database
  
#     Given the following teams exist:
#     | group_members | num_members | num_pending_requests | declared | request |
#     | George Su | 1 | 0 | No | Invite |
#     | Derek Hsiao, Ken Chiu | 2 | 2 | Yes | Leave |
