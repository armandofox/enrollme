Feature: Table for finding and joining teams
  As a user
  In order to find an open team that suits my preferences

    | group_members | num_members | num_pending_requests | declared | request |

    | Hadi Zhang, George Poo | 2 | 1 | No | Join |
    | Karl Hayek, Brandon Jabr, Carina Boo | 3 | 10 | Yes | Join |
