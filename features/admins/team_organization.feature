#Feature: Use an admin acccount to see organized team data
#
#  As an admin
#  So that I can easily see different teams
#  I want to be able to switch between teams with different statuses
#
#  Background:
#    Given the following admins exist
#     | name | email                  |
#  	 | Bob  | supreme_ruler@aol.com  |
#    And the following users exist
#     | name  |       email                    |team_passcode | major           | sid  | waitlisted |
#     | Sahai | eecs666@hotmail.com            | penguindrool | EECS            | 000  | true |

#   	 | Copy  | anotheremail@yahoo.com         | ok           | CS              | 009  | true |
#     | Bob0      |    bobjones0@berkeley.edu         | passcode1 | Slavic Studies    | 824               | true |
#     | Bob1      |    bobjones1@berkeley.edu         | passcode1 | Slavic Studies    | 825               | true |
#     | Bob2      |    bobjones2@berkeley.edu         | passcode1 | Slavic Studies    | 826               | true |

#    And the following discussions exist
#   	 | number  | time         |  capacity |
#   	 | 54321   | Tues, 3pm    |  25       |
#    And I am on the login page
#    And I log in as an admin with email "supreme_ruler@aol.com"
#    And the team with passcode "penguindrool" is submitted
#    And the team with passcode "passcode1" is approved with discussion number "54321"
#
#  Scenario: A newly disapproved team should not be under the "Approved" category
#    Given I follow "Approved"
#    Then I should see "Bob0"
#    When I follow "disapprove_3"
#    And I follow "Approved"
#    Then I should not see "Bob0"
#
#  Scenario: A newly approved team should show up under "Approved"
#    Given I follow "Approved"
#    Then I should not see "Sahai"
#    When I follow "Pending"
#    And I follow "approve_1"
#    And I follow "Approved"
#    Then I should see "Sahai"
#
#  Scenario: A team with less than 5 members should show up under "Forming"
#    Given I follow "All"
#    Then I should see "Copy"
#    And I should see "Sahai"
#    When I follow "Forming"
#    Then I should see "Copy"
#    And I should not see "Sahai"
#
#  Scenario: An admin first sees teams under the "Pending" and "Approved" category only
#    Given I am on the home page
#    Then I should see "Bob0"
#    And I should see "Sahai"
#    And I should not see "Copy"
#
#  Scenario: The "Pending | Approved" category should only contain teams that are pending or approved
#    Given I follow "pending_or_approved"
#    Then I should see "Bob0"
#    And I should see "Sahai"
#    And I should not see "Copy"
